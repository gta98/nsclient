This project is an assignment I was given in one of my courses

It sends an RFC1035 compliant query to a DNS server specified by the user as an argument to the main program

It utilizes WinSock2.h for socket connectivity, due to course requirements, but `nsclient/socket_utils.c` can be modified easily to support socket.h
